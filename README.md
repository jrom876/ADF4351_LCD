Translation and Modification of Alain Fort's ADF4351 RF Signal Generator Driver for an Arduino LCD Shield

This excellent code by Alain Fort was originally written in French,
and needed significant translation and debug before it could actually
run in my custom frequency generator and amplifier circuit.

Contained herein is my rewrite of Alain's code, with all of his comments intact.

I left a little French in the translation for flavor.

This is being shared to help others who wish to use the ADF4351 with an Arduino LCD Shield.

CHEERS!
